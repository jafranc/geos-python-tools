Warning! The mesh contains 2300 elements with a pore volume below 0.0001 m^3.
The minimum pore volume is 3.360000042463221e-05 m^3.
Our recommendation is to check the validity of mesh and/or increase the porosity in these elements.


Warning! The mesh contains 77 elements with a porosity above 1.
The maximum porosity is 4464286.006363501.
